            <p>I'm a complex individual, normally seen to be nonchalant and playful towards my students, close
                colleagues, and friends. However, I'm unsympathetic and cruel towards sorcerer executives, an example
                being my blatant disrespect towards Principal Gakuganji, and his enemies.I was extremely confident in my
                abilities and reputation as a powerful sorcerer, believing himself to be invincible

                both immense amounts of cursed energy and a dangerously powerful technique.</p>

                <p class="finish">
                    Being an inversion of Blue, Red has the opposite effect. Using my reversal technique to invert the
                    properties of Blue, I activate the divergence of my infinity and causes an extremely powerful
                    repulsive
                    force, repelling all matter in its vicinity. Being an ability that is powered by positive cursed
                    energy
                    and formed as a reverse curse technique, the ability has two times the destructive ability of Blue.

                    A non-standard technique of Limitless more potent and destructive than the 2 standard forms that
                    only
                    select few know about, even among the members of the Gojo Family. Satoru snaps his fingers,
                    combining
                    "Blue" (attraction) and "Red" (repulsion), generating a long-ranged singularity where both effects
                    are
                    combined, deleting and erasing all matter in its path instantaneously.
